                            Kimberley
                            on a number of projects and can confidently say
                            that she is incredibly talented and professional. She has an eye for capturing
                            beautiful,
                            candid
                            moments in studio and on location in both product and fashion photography. She has a
                            unique
                            ability to make her clients feel at ease entrusting her with creating their content.</p>
                        <p class="">In addition to her exceptional photography
                            skills,
                            Kimberley is also a pleasure to work with. She
                            is responsive and always goes above and beyond to ensure that her clients are happy with
                            the
                            final product.</p>

                        <p class="">She worked closely with us and guides us through the entire process and by the
                            end of the shoots, we felt
                            she's been part of the bambuyu team. Shes a true star and a breath of fresh air.</p>
                        <p>We couldn't recommend her enough for your brand/product shoot.</p>

                        <p class="">I loved working with Kim. I am super picky on my content so I usually do
                            everything myself, but tried with Kim and haven't regretted it! </p>
                        <p class="">Her eye is on point; from the pictures, to angles, to the colors and the
                            editing. Everything was really aligned with our branding identity. She definitively
                            doesn't watch the clock, and is not afraid to work hard to match deadlines; even with
                            annoying clients like me.</p>

                        <p class="">I highly recommend Kim. She recently took pictures of my brand and the results
                            were fantastic. She was able to perfectly capture the essence and aesthetic of my
                            business in the photos. </p>
                        <p class="">Not only is Kim skilled in her craft, but she's very professional and easy to
                            work with. Kim listened to my vision and delivered exactly what was looking for. </p>
                        <p>I will definitely be using Kim for any future photography needs and I highly recommend
                            her to anyone in need of a talented and reliable photographer.</p>
