                <p class="">We've had the pleasure of working with
                    Kimberley
                    on a number of projects and can confidently say
                    that she is incredibly talented and professional. She has an eye for capturing
                    beautiful,
                    candid
                    moments in studio and on location in both product and fashion photography. She has a
                    unique
                    ability to make her clients feel at ease entrusting her with creating their content.</p>
                <p class="">In addition to her exceptional photography
                    skills,
                    Kimberley is also a pleasure to work with. She
                    is responsive and always goes above and beyond to ensure that her clients are happy with
                    the
                    final product. Her easy-going personality and flexibility make the creative process
                    easier
                    for
                    everyone involved.</p>

                <p class="">I highly recommend Kim. She recently took pictures of my brand and the results
                    were fantastic. She was able to perfectly capture the essence and aesthetic of my
                    business in the photos. </p>
                <p class="">Not only is Kim skilled in her craft, but she's very professional and easy to
                    work with. Kim listened to my vision and delivered exactly what was looking for. </p>
                <p>I will definitely be using Kim for any future photography needs and I highly recommend
                    her to anyone in need of a talented and reliable photographer.</p>

                <p class="">I loved working with Kim. I am super picky on my content so I usually do
                    everything myself, but tried with Kim and haven't regretted it! </p>
                <p class="">Her eye is on point; from the pictures, to angles, to the colors and the
                    editing. Everything was really aligned with our branding identity. She definitively
                    doesn't watch the clock, and is not afraid to work hard to match deadlines; even with
                    annoying clients like me.</p>

                <p class="">We had a very good idea of what we wanted to capture and how we wanted to bring

                <p class="">She worked closely with us and guides us through the entire process and by the
                    end of the shoots, we felt
                    she's been part of the bambuyu team. Shes a true star and a breath of fresh air.</p>
